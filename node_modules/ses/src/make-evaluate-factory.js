  // 1: we use 'with' (around a Proxy) to catch all free variable names. The
  // `this` value holds the Proxy which safely wraps the safeGlobal
  // 2: 'optimizer' catches constant variable names for speed.
  // 3: The inner strict function is effectively passed two parameters:
  //    a) its arguments[0] is the source to be directly evaluated.
  //    b) its 'this' is the this binding seen by the code being
  //       directly evaluated (the globalObject).
  // 4: The outer sloppy function is passed one parameter, the scope proxy.
  //    as the `this` parameter.

  // Notes:
  // - everything in the 'optimizer' string is looked up in the proxy
  //   (including an 'arguments[0]', which points at the Proxy).
  // - keywords like 'function' which are reserved keywords, and cannot be
  //   used as a variables, so they is not part to the optimizer.
  // - when 'eval' is looked up in the proxy, and it's the first time it is
  //   looked up after useUnsafeEvaluator is turned on, the proxy returns the
  //   eval intrinsic, and flips useUnsafeEvaluator back to false. Any reference
  //   to 'eval' in that string will get the tamed evaluator.
